"""What if the list has only 1 node and n = 1? (Should return None).
    
What if n equals the length of the list? (You remove the head).
    
What if n is bigger than the list length? (Your code currently returns the original head â€” worth pointing out).

What if head is None (empty list)?

Why not just start leader = trailer = head?

What happens if you try removing the head without a dummy?

Can you return an exception if n > length of the list?
Sure, raise ValueError("n is larger than the length of the list")
